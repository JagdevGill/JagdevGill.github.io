    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="section-text"> Hello! I’m Jack Gill, a student-athlete in my third year at McGill working on my Major in Mathematics and Biology. I have long been fascinated by the intersection of Mathematics and Biology and the potential for mathematical methods to enhance our understanding of complex biological systems. My passion lies in Neurology—a field I connect with personally as someone with cerebral palsy. This connection drives my commitment to exploring the intricacies of the brain and nervous system and finding ways to improve the lives of individuals with neurological disabilities.</p>
    <p class="section-text">Outside of academics, I am a member of Canada’s National Para Swimming team who recently had the honor of representing Canada at the 2023 Para Pan American Games where I earned a bronze medal in the 100m Freestyle. Through this digital portfolio, I aim to share my passion for life sciences, my journey as a student-athlete, and my desire to contribute to improving the lives of people with disabilities through innovative treatments and unique perspectives. Thank you for visiting—welcome to my digital portfolio!</p>
