    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="section-text"> Hello! I’m Jack Gill, a student-athlete in my third year at McGill working on my Major in Mathematics and Biology. I have long been fascinated by the intersection of Mathematics and Biology and the potential for mathematical methods to enhance our understanding of complex biological systems. I am particularly interested in Neurology because, as someone with cerebral palsy, I have a personal connection to understanding the complexities of the brain and nervous system, and to improve the lives of individuals with neurological disabilities. In addition, I am a member of Canada’s National Para Swimming team who recently had the honor of representing Canada at the 2023 Para Pan American Games where I earned a bronze medal in the 100m Freestyle. Through my journey, I hope that we can share a passion for life science research and a desire to improve the lives of people living with disabilities through innovative treatments and different perspectives. Welcome to my digital portfolio!</p>
